## Overview  

**CoinMinD** (Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Multinomial Proportions) is an R package that provides an extensive set of **classical** and **Bayesian** procedures for computing **simultaneous confidence intervals (SCIs)** for multinomial proportions.  
It integrates a range of established statistical methods in one interface, helping users compare, visualize, and interpret interval estimates for categorical outcomes.

---

## Key Features  

- Implements **eight major SCI methods** for multinomial proportions.  
- Supports both **frequentist** and **Bayesian Dirichlet** frameworks.  
- Handles **equal and unequal prior settings** for Bayesian inference.  
- Includes built-in visualization and summary functions.  
- Written purely in **R**, ensuring platform independence and easy installation.

## Implemented Methods  

### ðŸ”¹ Classical (Frequentist) Methods  

| Method | Reference | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Wilson (WS)** | Wilson (1927) | Adaptation of the Wilson score interval for multinomial proportions; provides improved coverage accuracy. |
| **Quesenberry & Hurst (QH)** | Quesenberry & Hurst (1964) | Extends chi-square-based binomial intervals to the multinomial case with simultaneous coverage control. |
| **Goodman (GM)** | Goodman (1965) | Constructs family-wise simultaneous confidence intervals using a chi-square adjustment. |
| **Wald (WALD)** | Wald (1939) | Classical normal approximation intervals; straightforward but may miscover for small samples. |
| **Wald with Continuity Correction (WALDCC)** | â€” | Modified Wald intervals that include a continuity correction to improve coverage. |
| **Fitzpatrick & Scott (FS)** | Fitzpatrick & Scott (1987) | Uses moment-matching and chi-square approximations; often narrower than Goodmanâ€™s intervals. |
| **Sison & Glaz (SG)** | Sison & Glaz (1995) | Based on saddlepoint and moment approximations, offering accurate coverage for small to moderate sample sizes. |
| **Friedrich et al. (2017)** | Friedrich, Konietschke & Pauly (2017) | Provides simultaneous confidence intervals derived from multiple contrast tests; flexible and modern approach for multinomial data. |

### ðŸ”¹ Bayesian Methods  

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **BMDE (Bayesian Dirichlet â€“ Equal Prior)** | Constructs simultaneous credible intervals under a Dirichlet posterior assuming equal prior parameters. |
| **BMDU (Bayesian Dirichlet â€“ Unequal Prior)** | Allows user-specified (unequal) priors to reflect prior knowledge or asymmetry among categories. |

Both Bayesian methods yield either **equal-tail** or **highest posterior density (HPD)** intervals based on posterior draws from the Dirichlet distribution.

## Example Usage

```r
# Load the CoinMinD package
library(CoinMinD)

# Example data: counts for four categories
x <- c(12, 18, 25, 15)

# Compute simultaneous confidence intervals using different methods

# Classical methods
res_goodman <- GM(x, alpha = 0.05)
res_wald <- WALD(x, alpha = 0.05)
res_waldcc <- WALDCC(x, alpha = 0.05)
res_wilson <- WS(x, alpha = 0.05)
res_qh <- QH(x, alpha = 0.05)
res_fs <- FS(x, alpha = 0.05)
res_sg <- SG(x, alpha = 0.05)

# Bayesian methods
res_bmde <- BMDE(x, p = 0.1)
res_bmdu <- BMDU(x, d = 2)

# Print summaries
print(res_goodman)
print(res_wald)
print(res_waldcc)
print(res_wilson)
print(res_qh)
print(res_fs)
print(res_sg)
print(res_bmde)
print(res_bmdu)
